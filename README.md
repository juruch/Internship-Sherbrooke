## Introduction
This project is the work I did during my two months summer research internship at the University of Sherbrooke - Department of Computer-Science.

## Week 1
I began by redoing the (following code)[https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2025/mlr3torch-conv/], only changing the number of epochs from 200 to 2 to make it run on my own computer.
I also learned about the precision-recall curve by redoing (this code)[https://www.blog.trainindata.com/precision-recall-curves/] using the iris dataset (with the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-virginica). I first coded it in pyhton to follow the tutorial.
